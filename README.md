The makefile has been created for GCC ANSI on Linux.

The following files were part of my coursework for ECM 2433 C Family.

The coursework revolved around three main questions which can be seen in ecm2433-ca.pdf: 

1. Making a piglatin solver
2. Making a riffle shuffle function for a deck of any type in size
      -The shuffle had to be done in place with one additional work array given.
3. Beggar your neighbour simulation
